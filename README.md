## OpenWeather CRA app

A CRA (create-react-app) frontend that allows the user to enter a location and be presented with the weather there, which uses the [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) system.


### Process
OpenWeather is pretty easy to sign up for, and all membership options use ["One Call API"](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) which looks like an updated API that bundles current, minute, hourly, daily and some historical data all in one. Great!
